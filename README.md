# Research Assistant using EdgeChains

## About the Project
This project is made by me using EdgeChains library. It is a simple AI application that works like a research assistant. You give a topic, and it will generate a summary for you using AI. I made this to try learning new things and see how EdgeChains can be used.

## How to Run the Code
1. First, make sure Node.js is installed on your laptop. You can download it from here.
2. Then, clone this repo: git clone <repository-url>.
3. Open the folder in terminal using cd edgechains-sample.
4. Run this command to install library: npm install @arakoodev/edgechains.
5. Finally, run the app using: node researchAssistant.js.

## How It Works
Once you run it, the program will ask for a topic you want to research. For example, you can enter "Benefits of renewable energy" or anything else. The app will send this to OpenAI and give back a detailed summary about the topic. Itâ€™s like a mini researcher for you.

## What I Learned
This was my first time trying something with EdgeChains, and I learned how to connect AI models with code. It was not easy, but I managed to make it work. I also learned how to use Node.js to run JavaScript code and send requests to APIs.

## Things to Improve
I think I can add more features in future like saving the summary to a file or allowing users to ask follow-up questions. But this is a good start for now!
